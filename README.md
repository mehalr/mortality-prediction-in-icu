# Mortality prediction in ICU
- Patients admitted in the ICU suffer from critical illness or injury and are at a high risk of dying. 
- ICU mortality rates differ widely depending upon underlying disease process with death rates as low as 1 in 20 for patients admitted following elective surgery and are high as 1 in 4 patients with respiratory diseases . 
- The risk of death can be approximated by evaluating the severity of patients illness as determined by important physiologic clinical and demographic determinants.
- Using machine learning algorithms, we are predicting in-hospital death of critically ill patients with considerable accuracy and identifying factors contributing to the prediction power.

# Algorithms used
- Random Forest Classifier
- KNN Classifier
